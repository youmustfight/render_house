# RENDERHOUSE
Fun ecommerce project done in about a week and a half. Live on Heroku with a MongoLab db hooked in and working authentication. Didn't get Stripe working so people could tip creators though unfortunately.

RENDERHOUSE is an angular webapp, with a three.js directive that loads in products a user views. It included comment functionality, inline editing, downloading (local, didn't get AWS integrated yet), purchase histories, and admin panels.

Check it out @ renderhouse.io!
